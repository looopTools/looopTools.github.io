                                  Now this is going to be more personal. As can be seen above I am nerd by education,
                                  but I am also a nerd in my so called spare. I am the author of IrisPause an open
                                  source application for taking micro breaks and have contributed to multiple open
                                  source projects over the years, I also am a open source evangelist by such I enjoy
                                  to introduce (I am a bit fanatic) to open source and its possibilities.
                                  <br />
                                  Besides the software stuff, I also like play Magic The Gathering, Pen and Paper
                                  RPG's (currently Supernatural based in the seventies) and I love playing board
                                  games, where I am currently in love with <i>Lord of Water Deep</i> and <i>Gloom</i>.
                                  <br />
                                  I also enjoy reading books in the genres of <i>Fantasy</i>,<i>Mystery</i>,
                                  <i>Sci-Fi</i> and <i>Science</i>. Which also is inspiration for my oven novels and
                                  short stories which I am currently working. Just a bit of random information my
                                  current favourite book is <i>Percy Jackson and The Olympians - The Last Olympian by
                                    Rick Riordan</i>.

                                  Some have asked me if they can help me continue working on my software and books
                                  via economic donations. Well not really no not really, I can pay my rent and buy
                                  my food, so all good. But if you want me to have a bit more luxuries life, you can
                                  buy me something from my amazon wish list: <a class="fa fa-amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/3FZQ1T6OPVM1D"></a>
