Three Sisters, Three Faiths, is the first novel in a series I am planing and is currently in a very
early stage.

Three Sisters, Three Faiths, is a fantasy novel which gets inspiration from some of my favourite fantasy
novels, but also have a lot of my own ideas and of course my own plot line. The idea of the book is to
question the need for a blood line to have a faith, the idea of not having an actual father. What
war does not just to a family, but an entire people.

The first unedited, non spell checked version of the very first paragraph of the very first chapter:

_It was a very beautiful morning, in a very large city near the sea. In this city there is an apartment, which houses five people. A pair of twins and a set of triplets, some might think that they live without their parents. But no, they do not live without their parents or more precisely, they live without a father. You see or do you not? The twins are from one generation of the family and the triplets are from a younger generation. The twins are Shardy and Michell Niria, or so the the triplets think. The triplets name in order of age are Sophia, Noon and Dawn also with the last name of Niria or so the triplets think._
