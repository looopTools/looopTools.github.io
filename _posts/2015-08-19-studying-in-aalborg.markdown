So I have posted about studying in Aalborg on my old blog at blogger. Now I will compile my experience of studying 2 years in Aalborg, in this blog post.

## The environment at the University.
Well I will split this section into two different parts, the first year and the second year, The reason for this, is due to the fact, that the two years are on two very different places.

#### The first year
Most first year students whom attend the university and belongs to the faculty of Science, are gather in a place called Basis. This places tries to ensure that people from different fields meets doing social events, such as the RUS Period (the first two weeks of studying), or the bar on Friday.

However even though the ruslinger (newbies) do attend the bar or social events, they tend to band together based on field of study. So not many meet across field of study. However the buildings and general environment are wonderful and pretty spacey. So for a project based educational institution such as AAU, that is really great, since there are group rooms, which are assigned to an individual group. So the environment is very good doing the first year. BUT! it becomes even more awesome after the second year, when we move to or department.

#### The Second year and be on
As a software engineering or computer science student, the first new thing that happens doing your second year of study. Is moving from Basis in Aalborg C, to Cassiopeia / Department of Computer Science in Aalborg E. This a completely new experience, we are now at the actual campus, at the eastern frontier, the last bastion before the country site.

The build are not new, but they are comfortable and couchy, we have table tennis tables, football tables, game consoles and stuff like that. We have our own club which server Friday french bread, every Wednesday and in general there is a really relaxed and nerdy environment, which should sooth every nerd.

So the conclusion is, that the environment, you as a student are surrounded by is pretty damn good.

## The Problem based learning
At Aalborg University students are taught by a education form, known as Problem Based Learning (PBL). A short explanation might be in order. At Cassiopeia this means using the tools and knowledge we are taught, in a semester project each semester. Where the project topic, is relevant to the subjects you are following as a student, and the project is performed in groups of 4 - 7 people, depending on the semester. This forces/allows you to learn how to work in group and as a unit, but also learn how to handle conflicts and so on.

This form of education is just to my liking and it really has taught me to work better in a unit and be better at delivering information and receiving information. Also this PBL form has also taught me to communicate complex information doing the exam, which is always oral for the project.

So if you like group based project work, I can really recommend Aalborg University.

Examples of project I have worked on are:

-  Asgard - Functional programming language for parallel computation and the compiler Yggdrasil
-  Tournament Planner - An application for planning football or other sport tournaments.
-  MIDI Music analyser - An application for recommendation music like Sharzam


## Conclusion
I really do enjoy studying at Aalborg University and PBL based education form. However there are problems up ahead, we are now so many students, that there are now not enough group rooms for all groups at Cassiopeia, that is a problem. Because most groups really do use the group rooms as an office, which are important for project work. So, so far I am really satisfied, but let us see if it stays that way.

This is not the final post about this subject, I will keep updating about projects we do, and my time at the university
