title: Going Markdown for book notes
categories: markdown emacs
---
So for a long time I have been trying out different ways to take notes for my books and writing character sheets. However no tool I have found actually does exactly what I want. The tools where either too complex or relied to heavily on muse interaction or the internet. The latter is a problem as I have a tendency to disable the internet when I write, to minimise the possible distractions during my process.

So what options do I have then. Well I have a text processing program such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, or a note taking program such as OneNote. But and thing all these have in common is that they are uselessly heavy and have a strange workflow in my opinion. This is not saying that they are not excellent applications. So where should I then turn? Well Emacs of course it is my favourite editor and it can actually do a lot of the things I want, with a mode called Org or Organisation mode. But at the moment I do not have the time to learn a new mode (Christmas holly day is coming)... So what to do? Well it turns out that Org mode likes Markdown and so do I. Therefore I will start using it for my notes.

But why do I choose Markdown and not ReStructuredText (rst)? Well first of there is not a big difference and I just prefer the syntax of Markdown. However it is also to streamline the amount of formats I use and as I am already using Markdown for this blog, README files, university notes and so on. It just makes sense to go Markdown.

So now you know why, but what does this mean? It means that I will come with some blog post about how to use Markdown in Emacs, how to convert it pdf's and latex and a few other things.
