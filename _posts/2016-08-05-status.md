So if you follow me on twitter, you will know that I do check my email and that
I have promised a status update. So let us get started with that.

First of I apologize for not posting more, but I have been very buzzy. It is not
an excuse for not posting but rather a reason for why I hopefully will be
posting more soon.

## Status on my book

I have decided to change my approach to how I write a bit. Instead of forcing
myself to write, I will be writing when I have inspiration, which seems to give
a much better result. Also I will be writing more detailed character sheets, as
this sometimes have put a stop to my writing, as I was not completely certain
how a given character would react, and especially one particular character have
given me troubles. But I am still working on the book, and so far I am happy
about writing.

## Status on projects

GOOD NEWS IrisPause is currently being tested by a couple of developers I know
whom also have problems with RSI injuries and they seem to like it.

logJS has been site lined at the moment, not because I do not want to make it
better, but because I am currently working on a benchmarking tool for C++. Which
requires a lot of my attention at the moment. But Lars that project is not on
your github page profile. Yes it is, it is just private until I have worked a
lot more on the code and how to make proper profiles.

## Status on blog

It is my goal to make a post at least once every second week from now on.

But that is not why this point is on the agenda, the reason is that I am
currently working on a new theme. Again really? Yes, this is because I do not
like the currently design, I think it is strange and it reminds a lot about
another webpage I designed lately, and I would like to get away from this.
The design should be more sleek and simple and less confusing elements.

## Personal life

I have completed my first university degree, and now holds a Bachelor in
Software Engineering, so that is good and I will start on my masters the second
of September.

Hope to see you here soon.
