title: Atom and Spacemacs the final chapter
categories: programming editor
---
At the beginning of this I said I would use Atom and Spacemacs over the summer.
For me the summer usually my summer is two months and by such I would have had
plenty of time to really play around with the two editors, and realizing the
different pros and conns of the two editors. However after a month one contestant
is out, and that constant is Spacemacs.

So why is Spacemacs out? To be honest I have given up on making it work as it is
supposed to. I have seen countless videos on youtube, read blog posts and reddit
post about how to setup Spacemacs on Machintosh and OS X. However what ever I
have tried, from a one of the above, have not worked. I do not know if I am
useless or if my Spacemacs installation is broken, but I have given up on
Spacemacs.

Now it is not the last time I will be looking at Spacemacs, I will continue to
try and figure out what is actually wrong with my installation of Spacemacs and
fixing it, for I do like what it brings to the table.

But does this mean that I will go back to Emacs? No it does not, it means I will
switch completely to Atom for the rest of the summer at least. So far I must say
I am very satisfied with Atom and it has done a lot for me so far in the terms
of RSI. Though this maybe in combination with my usage of the RSI application
Workrave.

I hope you will continue to follow my adventures with Atom and if it helps with
my RSI
