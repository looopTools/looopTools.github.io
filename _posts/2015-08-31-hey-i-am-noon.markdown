Well erhmm hello I am Noon. The third triplet, second oldest and second youngest. I am not like the others, they are some freaking annoyingly bright and light all the time. Unlike the two morons (whom I actual love greatly), I prefer pitch black nights, where I can see the stars and the moon. The night makes me calm, I find it comfort in it, like I find comfort in being alone. My mom say I take after my father in that. Well I do not know, we have never meet him (I think this is in the story).

Though I find calmness in darkness, I come of as a bit nervous even, when I am there. I hate being put on the spot and through all this stupid angle crap, I only wanted to meet my father and see if my mother tells the truth, that I am more like him, than her.

And eeeh Lars have asked me to write more about my self and my family. I think I will do it, but I will only write late a night.
