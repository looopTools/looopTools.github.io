A new initiative by Prosa and Platform4, aims to give talks about IT related topics, with relation to students
and will be called IT X and the first event will be about open source.

I have been so fortunate to be asked to give a twenty minute talk about a subject
I find interesting or informative. I have chosen to talk about How to use open source in student projects, and
what you as a student need to think about. I will publish the slides on slide share afterwards.

The event will be held at Platform4 the 24 of February 2016 and will be held from 7:00pm to 10:00pm
