## New way

Hey I know it seems like I am not doing much work on Three sisters, three faiths. But I am still working on it. This is a new way I will introduce characters, from what I call the Kiljaren order or Order of Kiljaren.
Not all of these will make an appearance in the first book and some may never. I just like to write about them.
