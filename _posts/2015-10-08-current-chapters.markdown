I have started to compile two of the chapters for my book, and would like to tell a bit about the different chapters, which I have planned so far and their names.

## Names
Well each chapters has been given a name according to something that happens with in a chapter or someone or somethings which are meat in a chapter. Here is a list of the chapters, I have currently planned to include:

-  Awakening
-  The masters of fog
-  A second home
-  Even mother did not know
-  A turn to darkness
-  Why pain is necessary

It is not a chronological order, and it is far from the entire first book, but about a third.

The current two chapters I have started is _Awakening_ and _The masters of fog_, both are placed in the beginning of _Three sisters, three faiths_.

I know this is a very short update, but I like to keep all a bit up to date.
