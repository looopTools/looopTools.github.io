Hello, I am going to do something stupid. I am going to make a blog post series and the series is called _Why can't I?_.
The purpose of this series is to create a set of blog posts which each covers a subject I have discussed with either colleagues
or friends, and all have started with the question Why can't I...

In some cases I will have an answer to why you cannot and in some case I will explain how you can actually do the thing, you
think you cannot do.

I filed this under the tags _tech_, _guide_, and _stuff_. The reason is that predominantly it will be tech related and sometimes
include a guide. BUT! My friends and I are strange so sometimes it might cover a food related topic or something even stranger.

This is also an attempt to get me blogging more regularly and to increase the content on my blog. I hope you will enjoy it
