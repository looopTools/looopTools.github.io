God day dear Madam or Sir.

As Lars have asked me, to introduce my self, I have written this little piece of text.

Well my name is Sophia, and I am the eldest sister of a set of triplets. I prefer to study rather than wasting time. My mother even says I am her _little Athena_ once in a while. I might come off as a bit arrogant and all knowing, but I do not intent it so, and it makes me sad to be called arrogant.

Besides my interest in studying, I also like nature and especially when our mother and uncle takes us for trips to the country side or a mountain area. It some how makes me calm, particular when I am near water.

Like Dawn I will also write more later, not just about my self but the rest of my family. I really hope you will have a beautiful day and that we will talk later.

_- Sophia Nerana_
