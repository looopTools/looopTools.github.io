IrisPause is now in state where there is a need for it to be tested by more people than just me. Therefore I make this public call for beta testers.

If you are interested to be a beta tester of [lnc13 (dot) lars (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:lnc13.lars@gmail.com?Subject=[IrisPause] About: Call for beta tester). Please write your full name and os x system

## What will happen

- First you will send an email to say that you want to be a beta tester
- Then you will receive a download link to the application and installation instruction
- Then after installation you will be using the application
- Then if you find a missing feature, you will (hopefully) create an issue here: [irisPause - issues](https://github.com/looopTools/irisPause/issues/new)*
- Then or if you find a bug, you will (hopefully) create an issue here: [irisPause - issues](https://github.com/looopTools/irisPause/issues/new)**

*Please start feature request title with _[Feature]_

**Please start bugs issues title with _[bug]_ and label as bug

## What is require
These are the requirements for you and your hardware:

- Able to communicate in English
- A github account
- Mac OS X 10.9+

## Important

- This is unpaid and 100% voluntary
- If you contribute bug reports or feature request, you can get your name on the testers list, if you want.
- I expect you to use the application daily for 2 weeks
- I will store your name, email and the day you became a beta tester
