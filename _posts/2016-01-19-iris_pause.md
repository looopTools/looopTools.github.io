For a long time I have been looking for a micro break application for OS X. But I have been unable to find one which fits my needs or rather I found [Workrave](http://www.workrave.org). However I was unable to get Workrave, to work on OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan. There for I have decided to develop a Mac only fully open source application.

The application will be called IrisPause, is developed with the programming language Swift and is under the GPL Version 3. The project is public available on github: [IrisPause](https://github.com/looopTools/irisPause)

I am really excited about this application, as it is my first project fully written in Swift and for OS X only. In extension to this I would also like both alpha and beta testers, so if you are interested in becoming a tester I would very much like to here from you. You will however not get paid, this for yours and mine experience and to make IrisPause, a awesome application.

__Status:__ Still in development.
