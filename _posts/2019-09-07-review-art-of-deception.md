title: "[Book Review] The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security by Kevin Mitnick"
categories: [Book review]
---

Over the years one of the techniques that comes up over and over again
as one of the most efficient hacking techniques is _Social
Engineering_.  The technique requires you to be a high quality
con-artist in many cases, both in person, over the phone or text. One
person who is an amazing Social Engineer is Kevin Mitnick [[1]][1]. He
has written/co-written a lot of books on IT Security, where one of
these books is The Art of Deception [[2]][2]. It is a book I have read
a few times from cover to cover and some times used as a reference,
when explaining the idea of social engineering to people. I have just
never gotten around to write a review, so here it is.

# Overall

The book is split into four parts where the first part focuses on the
weakest link in most security, not just IT, the human element. The
part outlines how humans act and behave, even on a subconscious level
and it is possible to exploit this in general. 

The second part of the book focus on what an attacker can do to use
his/her skills to attack a company and how an attack can behave when
gaining trust/access. 

The third part of the book is similar to the second part, but focus on
attacks with a higher risk of discovery. As an example there is a full
chapter on _Entering the Premises_. 

The fourth part is focused on how we can increase the awareness
towards Social Engineered intrusions and in general increase the
awareness of security.

The parts are well structure and "build" on top of each other, in the
sense that they can be read individually. But you will get a better
understanding why the attacker is doing a specific thing if you have
read the chapter/section is build on top off. However, I highly
recommend that on your first read you do not skip any of the first
part of the book. It is the foundation for why __any__ of the
following attacks will work and it is explained without "to much
psychology".

# Presentation

All parts of the book, first explains a concept from an abstract point
of view, followed by one or more well structured concrete
examples. This gives the read a deeper understanding of how the
process of the concept works and how to use it in reality. The
examples are also the gateway drug for newcomers to the world of
social engineering, as they make it seem approachable. _Side note:_ I
was listening to the podcast Darknet Diaries [[3]][3] where the IT
security professional known as Tinker [[4]][[5]] was interviewed in
the episode _Jeremy from marketing_[[6]][6]. During the interview
Tinker talked about Social Engineering a lot and because I had read
Mr. Mitnicks book, the attacks and techniques described was very easy
to follow.

One critic, I have is that some times the attack seems to expect the
target, to be of either an extremely low IQ or way to trusting. But
that is the only critic I have and I would highly recommend people to
read the book, even if they have no interest in IT what so ever. They
might learn a thing or two.
