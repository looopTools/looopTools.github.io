Well first of all hello this is a personal update and status, and a reason why I have not been posting.

So status I am still working at Steinwurf and studying at AAU. I primarily spend my time studying, working on irisPause, some other open source stuff, working for steinwurf, design a website for a professor at AAU.

BUT the real reason why I have not been posting is actually because I have spend some A LOT of time writing preliminary stories around _Three sisters three faiths_, I find this need to develop some characters more before actually writing the rest of my first book.

This has been so time consuming that I have needed to take a break from blogging and other stuff as well.
