During the last couple of days I have read about a patent Apples has been granted (for more details: 
[9to5mac](http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/28/apple-patent-infra-red-block-photos/)), I will not be talking 
about why I think the technology is awesome and that I actually see really good use cases for it. I 
will however be talking about why I see it as an invasion of our personal space and a limitation of 
our freedom of speech.
