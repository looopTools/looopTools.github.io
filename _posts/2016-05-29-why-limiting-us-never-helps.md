For years I have heard from employers, colleagues and customers, that the only system they are allowed to use and the developer tools they are using is chosen by the employer on a strategy level in the organisation.

In my opinion this is one of the stupidest thing I have heard about in the fields of Software Development. The reason I say this is due to my view on creativity and limiting what we have at our disposal. Because when I want to write my novels, develop my code or write documents, I hate being limit in the tools I can use. I feel less productive when I am limit, it feels like I limit my train of thought and that I cannot think as freely.

In software development it is very important to enable creative when solving complex problems, otherwise you are simply not able to solve the problem in an efficient manner. Of course
