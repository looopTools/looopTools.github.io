For a long time I have complained about the game genre RTS (Real Time Strategy) have been 
dead and I have been looking for some good open source options. I have found one really 
promising and one which is ready to be played now. The promising one called 
[0 A.D](https://play0ad.com) and is currently in alpha, but is really well designed and 
graphically beautiful. The other option which is ready play is [openRA](http://www.openra.net)
which is an open source clone of the very popular game Red Alert. This post will be a review of
openRA. I will not be posting any screen shorts, the reason for this is that I really want you to 
visit their website and take a look around. 

__Installation:__ I have tried the openRA on Manjaro and OS X and describe the installation process 
for both systems. Now there are multiple ways to install OpenRA on Manjaro, I used AUR repositories 
and the package manager called yaourt. When you have setup yaourt run the following command:
`yaourt -S openra` which should install all dependencies and you should be good to go. 

On OS X download the newest release from the openRA webpage, you will get a zip file which you should 
extract and move the content to your Applications folder. BUT before you do this, you need to install 
mono which can be downloaded from [mono-project](http://www.mono-project.com). Then after end installation
you must open openRA. The first time will take between one and five minutes, this is due to mono's brilliant 
need for indexing your fonts. 

__Game Play:__ If you are familiar with the old school command and conquer games such as Tiberian Sun, Red 
Alert and Command and Conquer. You will be meet with a familiar interface and menu systems, which makes you 
feel young again. Though the graphics are from an era before the current millennium
