I woke up next to a river, hmmm where was this? It is beautiful a wide river, surrounded by a wide plain of grass and flowers, the sun was straight over me.

It is extremely calming yet I am not calm, for I cannot recall how I got here, and for some reason I cannot recall who I am. It is like it was washed from my mind, almost like I was born anew.
What could have done this? What or who would do this to me? "Are you confused my old friend? This is both your curse and your blessing" a voice spoke in my head. I was certain that it was only
in my head, for I could see no one. I thought "Who are you and what do you mean? What has happened?", even though I did not mean to, my mind shuttered I felt afraid and it was clear in my mind.
"Relax my old friend... You have simply gotten a second chance not something our kind often get. You must find your way back, you must learn to be you again, to remember who you are and until
then you are alone, even I cannot help you". The voice left my mind, even though I called to it there was no answer, and all I knew was that I need to find myself again.

## _A Little explanation of this_

About three weeks ago I read a old Greek legend, about a person losing his memory and had to find him self again. I will not tell which as this will give the plot away. This is however a small series,
which will be my take on the story. It will be a longer (short) series, contain maybe three or four paragraphs per part. But I hope you will enjoy it.
