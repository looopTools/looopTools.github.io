Well meet human, son or daughter of Adam and Eve. I am Gabriela sister of Gabriel the herald of God. As the others whom have already introduced them self. Lars have asked me to give a short introduction, and this I have granted.

I am Gabriela, as I have already written. I am one of the unmentioned archangel, and I hold the title; Angel of the Moon. As such I prefer night to day and I have enjoyed it for many aeons.

Besides being an archangel, I am also the wife of a fallen angel. Though it is a long time since I have seen my love last, my love is still true.

This is all the knowledge I will grant you today. Maybe later I will write again.

Gods blessing upon you human, may tomorrow favour you.

_- Gabriela_
