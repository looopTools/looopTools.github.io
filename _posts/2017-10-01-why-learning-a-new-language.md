__NOTE:__ _This post will be updated_

Almost everyday a new programming language see the dawn of life and quickly flickers into none existence.
But once in a while comes a language that will blow away most developers and it will change the way developers
like to code or a new language comes with a new a very cool concept. Examples of such languages are LISP, C,
Obj-C and C++, Simula. Erlang, and Haskell.

Unfortunately throughout my career as a software developer and student, I have seen a saddening tendency with
developers and that is, they do not really want to learn new programming language. This in turn results in developers
getting out of sync, with what is actually possible and which languages actually can help you, do your job better.

However, it is true that most companies select one, two, maybe even three languages and stick with them. In Denmark
it has a tendency to be C#, Java, JavaScript, and maybe C++, and the only thing really changing are which frameworks
are being used.

## So why bother learning a new language?

First of learning a new language might force you to learn a new programming paradigm, if you go with Haskell it is
the functional paradigm, with Pharo it is the object oriented paradigm, and C would be the imperative programming paradigm.
But what good does this do? Firstly, it forces you to think about tasks in a different manner and for instance in the case
of functional programming, you are forced to think with a more mathematical mindset, By acquiring a secondary way of thinking,
you will adapt to a more multi-phased process when addressing problems and have a better idea about how to solve a given problem.

Secondly, keeping your finger on the pulse of what is happening. By learning new languages or new language concepts, you
increase your knowledge and by such your skill set. This allows you to make more informed decision, when choosing language
or techniques. This will in tern also make you more desirable for companies to heir, as you have an high level of understanding
about what is trending and what could be used to solve a task.


## But are the problems?

Yes, there are problems and the problem is learning too many languages. Why is that a problem? Well if you know 10+ languages you
will not know them sufficiently in-depth to be called an expert and you will start to confuse languages with each other. In this
interview _["Bjarne Stroustrup: The 5 Programming Languages You Need to Know"][:1]_ by BigThink, Mr. Stroustrup talks about how
many languages you should know and why you should learn new ones.

Another problem, less common in software development circles but on I am guilty of is _Language Jumping_, if you come from the
Linux community you might know the term distro jumper. This is basically the same principal, often switching between programming
languages and by such start to confuse them with one another. This gives a high level of confusion, especially if you switch between
many languages throughout the day.

So therefore you need to manage how many languages you know and how often you switch between them.

## So what programming language do I recommend

First of I am not a UI or web developer anymore and that will be reflected in my list.

So the first language is [Go][:2], not because Go is weirdly used, yet, but because for an introduction to and daily work with
imperative and semi object oriented programming Go is awesome. It removes the need to know about pointers and how to interact with
them, giving a much more approachable way to learn imperative programming. Also if you are truly insane you can 100% mod object
orientation in Go. I will not call it true OOP because we only have structs not classes and no inheritance. The language is easy to
use and is enforcing a pretty formatting in my opinion.

The second language is... C#, NOT! because it has amazing libraries such as Linq, but because it is a simple and easy to use programming
language letting you fully explore the power of both OOP and Imperative programming, you can even mix and match. Furthermore, the
language have an enormous use base and amazing documentation, making it easy to join up. Finally with [.Net Core][:3] Microsoft
is allowing both development and deployment of software in C# on Linux and Mac, which you know I am hugh fan of. In the old days
I would have said Java due to C# only being windows compliant but not any more.

Thirdly C, though most modern language has abstractions from memory management and pointers, it is still good to have more in-depth
understanding of what the is going on. C is harsh in that way, as you have to handle, almost, everything your self and if somethings
goes boom it is your fault. Therefore C is on my list. Now also for embedded programming it is also almost a must to know C, but it
is not on the list for that reason.

Fourthly, [Haskell][:4], now I am not very good a Haskell yet myself as I was taught LISP. But Haskell is one of the cleanest programming
languages out there and forces you to learn the functional paradigm. The language is not easy to use nor get use too, if you are more
family with imperative and OOP languages. But I think it is worth the time.

Finally, [Rust][:5], WHAT THE FUCK IS Rust???? Rust is "newcommer" in terms of programming languages and is used for system programming and
[Mozilla Servo][:6] is made in it. Rust is meant as an alternative to C and it is really easy to understand and learn if you are used to C.
Now I am still a newcommer to this language, but I really, really enjoy using it and I see similar run times, compared to C. I can even see
Rust as the long awaited replacement for C, if it gets the proper adaptation by the community of embedded and system developers.

This is my current list. I will update this post with more information and more about why I think certain languages is a waste of time
and which I think people should consider learning, even if they are not on my list.
