title:  "I switch from Fedora to Manjaro"

For years I have advocated the usage of RPM distributions and in particular openSUSE and Fedora.

Almost from the beginning of my current job, I have used Fedora (1 month with openSUSE) and I have loved almost every minute of it.
The vanilla Gnome, yum/dnf, regular updates and super easy to maintain. It has been almost like sailing on a pink cloud and have just
been a easy road. However I have run into a problem with an update, the problem was that the update broke my ruby installation and since
I work with ruby this was kind of important and a pain in the buttocks. I tried to roll back the update but was unfortunately unsuccessfully in this.

This left me with two options, first try to fix the problem which I would have liked to try, but as this was my work desktop it did not have
the time to do that. So my second option was to reinstall my system, which also was the option I went with and again I was faced with another
choice. Should I stay with Fedora or try something else?

I have for a long time pondered if I should try Manjaro, because it gets rid of some of the pains of installing ArchLinux, but provides a pretty
stable rolling release distribution system which I like and are familiar with (I have run ArchLinux in the past). But my boss suggested that I used
Debian as it had gotten easier to use, though I have always thought it was pretty easy to use, and as some already know I do not like apt-get. So should
I try a system I would like to try out or if I should try a system which I knew to be rock solid, but I did not like in advance. I chose to go with Manjaro.

So what is my experience so far? Well compared to Fedora not much, I choose the XFCE release of Manjaro and installed Gnome as I am used to it and prefer it on
desktop systems. From my Fedora I brought my `.emacs` and `.bashrc` files, so that was already fixed. So basically it was like being home, just a different house.
Which basically has been awesome.

I have had one problem and that is FireFox will not start and I get a GTK mistake when trying. I have tried reinstalling FireFox and no dice, I however have talked
to other Manjaro users who know how to fix it. But at the moment I am using Opera, which is actually pretty awesome. So I am happy with my choice and it is so far
a very good experience and a awesome choice.

I would like to clarify a few things. I still like Fedora and see it as one of, if not the best, distribution for intermediate to professional users and that
I would like to return to Fedora one day, but at the moment I am really glad to use Manjaro and will continued using it for a while.
