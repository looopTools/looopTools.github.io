Hello creatures of the internet, 

I am pleased to announced that I got the good news that my paper
_Alexandria: A Proof-of-concept Implementation and Evaluation of
Generalised Data Deduplication_, I know the title is a mouth full, has
been accepted for the IEEE GLOBECOM 2019 Workshop on Edge Computing
for Cyber Physical Systems.

Best, <br />
