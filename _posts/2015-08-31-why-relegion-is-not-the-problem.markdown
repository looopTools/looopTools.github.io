For over five thousand years, humans have had a sense of there being something divine in the universe. This has for as long (as I know), made people argue, fight and kill each other, in the name of their respective god or gods. But is this a problem with religion or is it a problem with people? I do not think so, and this post will be about why I do not think so.

## 1. Human stupidity
Okay I am only twenty six, so this point of view may change over time. But at the moment I have the following point of view on this.

Humans have a tendency to explain the unexplained things, with unexplainable things. Or rather more specific, we could once not explain the creation of creature. Now we know, animals and so on, is create by two creatures having intercourse and that they have evolved over the eons. Yet humans claims animals in their current form, was created by a god. Even with over a million scientific papers, articles, books and observations. Certain humans still claims, that it is not true and it is not prof. However a divine creature, whom they have never seen a single proof of existences (no I do not see the bible as proof), has done it.

This is human stupidity, that humans will not face reality of science, when they are faced with prof. This leads on to the next subject.

## 2. Human stubbornness
Humans, all humans, have an extreme sense of stubbornness, when it comes to believes and for some reason especially when it comes to religion.

This stubbornness makes it impossible, even with scientifically proof or logic. To make people even open up their perspective on religion and their philosophy. Of course this also is relevant, not just for religious people, but also atheist, agnostics and so on.

## 3. Conversion of others
This literally pisses me of every god (hehe) damn time. When I inform people I am agnostic atheist, and then they try to convert me back to Christianity, some even tried to convert me to Islam. By arguing why religion is true, yet my counter arguments are based in science and they say then gets angry and claims I have no perspective on life.

But this need to force your own believes is the real problem of religion. You are not in power of what other believes, you are not deciding, what others believes.

This is what makes religion poisonous. It is not the religion itself, it is the people whom believe in a religion.

The Australian comedian Tim Minchin, has the most awesome sentence in his song _Confessions in three movements_. The sentence: _We're just fucking monkeys in shoes_, this is so true. Do not think you are greater, just because you think you know better, you do not always do. Remember that.
