title:  "[status] WHY DO YOU NOT POST"
categories: status

Well apparently some read my blog, I have been asked Why I have posted nothing for almost a month. SO! I thought it would
be a good time to post a status.

First of, on the 26th of May 04:00AM CET, my group and I handed in our Bachelor project, so most of my May, have been spend
on writing our Bachelor report and develop the corresponding product. Therefore I have not had enough time to also maintain
my blog.

However I should get more time to do this after the 10th of June, as I will be over most of my exams at this point Wuhuu!

BUT! I have not been completely useless as you hopefully have noticed. I have change the theme of the webpage and update the
about page. Please note that the Amazon thing is only if you really like my work.

So what have I planned in the pipeline? Well a lot of things; _Continued work on my book_, _Getting another guy to help
me develop irisPause_, _Return to work on Asgard_ and some other stuff. I will also hold another talk about open source.
So I will be doing a lot of stuff.

So I hope you will enjoy.
