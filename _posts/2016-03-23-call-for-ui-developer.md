The development of irisPause have been on pause for a while due to a buzzy life.

However irisPause is now at a state where we can start to prettify the user interface.

Therefore I am looking for a UI/UX designer and developer, who can help me design and implement a pretty user interface for both the application itself and for settings interface.

## IMPORTANT

Before you say yes please understand the following:

- There are no pay involved
- You do not retain the rights for the code, the project does that
- It is preferable if you have prior knowledge of SWIFT and XCODE usage

_If you want a contributor agreement licenses to be signed we can do that, just so you are 100% about your rights_
