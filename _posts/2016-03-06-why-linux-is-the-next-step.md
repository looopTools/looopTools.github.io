_"Why Linux is the next step?"_ What the f... is he rambling about? He has been using Linux for the past 11 years. Why is Linux the next step then?

Well I have been using Linux in some form since 2005. I have however used primarily Mac OS X as my main systems since 2008 and have been pretty contempt with it, due to multiple factors which I have discussed else where. But I am no longer completely contempt with the direction Mac OS X is taking, from an all around system to a completely consumer focused system, which for me is completely useless, Apple is locking down the UNIX features and parts of OS X, which are the parts I predominately use. Therefor I have to look at alternatives, which I can use and still feel like I am not giving up anything. There for Linux is the next thing for me.

What I mean with the above is, I want to use Linux as my main operating system and then people are going to ask why Linux, why not BSD or another UNIX distribution. Well there is a couple of reasons as per usual:

- Support on Laptops
- Full Gnome support
- Newer packages

### Support on Laptops

The general laptop support for is good on both FreeBSD and Linux, however the BSD system I would like to use which is OpenBSD, which has great support Lenovo Thinkpads and older laptops, which I cannot use for much. But why not just use FreeBSD then? Well for a couple of reasons, I have had a problem with Gnome (_see Full Gnome Support_), secondly I have had problems with graphic cards and mouse pads with FreeBSD as well, again not on Lenovo Thinkads. And as I am student I kinda need a laptop.

### Full Gnome Support

Well we all pick our poisons do we not? And my poison is Gnome, if I am not using Mac OS X and its awesome user interface I use Gnome, and I really love Gnome. BUT! a lot of the BSD system only partial supports Gnome and some of its awesome application. I have tried using XFCE but I just cannot get with the workflow. Though I am looking at options.

### Newer packages

Well this one is a bit of a pain for me, because I love the port system from FreeBSD and the way packages are installed on OpenBSD. But the packages has a tendency to be a bit old, which for certain things are okay. But for software libraries and codex that is not okay I needed that it is close to bleeding edge. Which there for I cannot use BSD.


### So when will this happen?

Hehe good question, I have decided to see what will happen with the next generation of Macbook Pro's and see if Apple change direction and go's back. But otherwise this summer when I get a new laptop.
