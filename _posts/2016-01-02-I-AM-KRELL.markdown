Hello I am Krell, I do not really or do I. I belong to those who work in the shadows. I have lived by many names, yet my family knows non of them. I have lived nowhere and everywhere. If you have not caught up yet, I can not help you more, and you will never understand me.

My full name is Krell Asira Neriell, I am full blood embrean and a member of the embrean army. You will notice me very little in Lars book, otherwise I am doing a horrible job.
