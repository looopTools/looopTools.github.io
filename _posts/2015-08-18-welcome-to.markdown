Finally The Phoenix has risen, from the ashes of a five year old pyre. My blog is up and running again. This first post will be about personal, format and topic updates

## Personal Update
Well why has it taken so long for me to republish my blog? Well that has been done to multiple reasons, I will state some here.

First back in 2010, when I started the original blog. I attend Aarhus University and that is actually one of the reasons I stopped blogging. While I attend Aarhus University I had a problem with the structure of the education system it self, simply to many exams in to short a period (they do not do semester based exams). This in combination, with problems in my family resulting with me going down with stress and dropping out of the University. The stress made me focus on what was important and what I wanted to do. So I decided to stop doing a lot of things I liked, including blogging.

So that is why I stopped, but why did it take me so long for me to start blogging again? Well first as I said I started to focus on things I wanted, these things was; getting an education and writing a novel. So this was what I focused on.

But now I feel ready to start blogging again, so I hope I can keep it up on a regular base.

## Format Update
Well first and hopefully you already realised it (otherwise read the blog post again ;) ). From now on all blog post's will purely be published in English. Unless I am ranting about a certain language.

Secondly, I have switched from a RoR based solution to a Jekyll solution, so it should work now!

## Topic Update
I will still post about the usual *NIX, Software development, open source and nerdy stuff. However I have chosen to break my golden rule, which means I will start to blog about religion and politics, so sorry in advance.


Hope you will enjoy the changes
