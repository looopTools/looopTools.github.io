So as some know, I have wanted to write a book / novel series for a while. But I have really been able to find the time nor had the ideas. But now I do not have the time, but I have a lot of ideas for a book and even for an entire series.

So what will it be about? Well it is very simple, the book will be set in a modern day universe based on our reality, and it will focus on a group of beings which are descendents of Angels, whom interacts with both humans, angels, devils, demons and other creatures. It will be a fantasy novel (surprise) and will be set on two different continents.

The series will be called... Well I need to think on this still. But the first book have been given the title of _Three daughters, three faiths_.

Now as I said, I do not have a lot of time, so it will be a lot of on and off writing. But I have the general story line of the first books and character sheets for a lot of the characters. So the book will be compiled on the fly, and I will post small snippets, when I feel they are ready.
