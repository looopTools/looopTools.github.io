As some might know, at Aalborg University we are taught by a philosophy of PBL (_Problem Based Learning_). 
The idea is to give the students close to real world problems to research and try to solve. In addition to 
the real world problems, most studies also have project either each semester or every other semester. At the 
department of Computer Science, we have a project each semester and we are organised in groups of 4-6 students 
who have to collaborate.

But what does this achieve? It actually achieves a lot. I have talked to students and graduates from other 
universities around the globe, and a thing which is a reoccurring challenge all of the experience when they are 
employed, is that they have to learn how to collaborate and being part of a team. But at Aalborg University we
are taught collaboration from day one and most student understand after the first semester why it is important
to collaborate.

So why is it important and again what does it achieve? Well first in the corporate world it is not uncommon to 
work in a team and have to collaborate with others. That is not just in the software industry, but almost all 
industries. So it is important to learn how to work with others and not just because you have to, but because 
it strength you and your colleagues skill set. But it is not just given that collaboration will enhance your skill
set that is a process and that is why it is important .
