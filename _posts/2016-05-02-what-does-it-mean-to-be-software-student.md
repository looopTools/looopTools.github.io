Hello long time no blog - This is the first part of a series about: _What does it mean to be a Software Engineering Student?_.

I would like to talk to you about something my professor, fellow students and I discussed in the course _Theory of Science_. We discussed the topic of _What is a Software Engineer and what is the difference compared to Computer Science_. I found this discussion really interesting and it inspired me to create this blog post. I will not be covering what I think it is to be a professional Software Engineer, but what in my opinion it means to be a Software Engineering student and the difference compared to a Computer Science student. Of course come of the things are applicable to what the difference between a professional Software Engineer and Computer Scientist.

## What mind set do you need?

An engineer needs a kind of unique mind set, because they are not just programmers, but they are not just researchers either. Engineers are the solution nerds, with this I mean that an engineer needs to be able to look at a problem and in a creative yet serious way being able to think about, design and come up with solution to a the problem. Therefore an engineer needs to mind sets at once, the imaginary one which can come up with the most amazing and ridiculous solution to a problem, but at the same time be able to understand the solution and have a rational thought by which an engineer can determine if a solution is feasible, efficient and possible an optimal solution. These two mind sets can be hard to get to go together. But the mind set is need to become Software Engineer and also a engineer student at least if your College / University follow a problem based learning approach where you are doing a project.

## You need to be able to see everything from an abstract approach

The running joke about engineers in general, not just Software Engineers is that: _Engineering mathematics does not contain numbers, but only letters_.

It is not completely wrong HA! we use numbers for coefficients. But it however puts forth a very good point, that you will need to see everything abstract, in the sense that when we look on a equation or equation system, we do not look for the solution for a single problem, but for as many problems as possible and by such we need to think about a problem in an abstract manner.

Next part will be about the skills you need in advance and what you will learn on the way.
