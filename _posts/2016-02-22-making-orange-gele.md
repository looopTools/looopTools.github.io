So new type of blog post, I will now start posting food recipes on random, and about random food stuff once in a while.

The topic for today is _orange jelly_

__Stuff you gonna need:__

- 4 - 5 leafs of gelatine
- 1 kg of ripe oranges (blood oranges are preferable in my opinion)
- 2 - 4 ripe lemons or 3 - 6 ripe limes
- 3/4 cup of sugar - You can complement with sugar, but you need to experiment
- 1 - 2 sticks of cinnamon
- 1/2 star anise
- a splash of cold water

__How to make orange jelly:__

1. Press the juice of the oranges in to a bowl and remove seeds
2. Press the juice of the limes in to another bowl and remove seeds
3. Put sugar in sauce pan and add a splash of water, then melt the sugar to a syrup
4. Slowly add the orange juice, while whisking the syrup
5. Let the orange juice sugar liquid cool, so you can taste it
6. Add lemon juice to taste
7. Add cinnamon and star anise
8. Bring the liquid back up to a broil
9. As soon as the liquid boils, turn of the head and lead star anise and cinnamon infuse, the liquid
10. After 5 - 10 minutes, remove cinnamon and star anise
11. Soak the gelatine for 5 minutes in cold water
12. Reheat the liquid such that you can dissolve the gelatine in the hot liquid
13. Put the liquid into sterilise jar(s) and let cool completely put on lids and store in the fridge
14. Let it be in the fridge for at least one day before using, this allows for development of the flavors

__Tips:__

- Sieve the liquid for a clearer jelly
- Make a test batch to see if the amount of star anise is to much for you. It would be a shame if it was to much.

__Usage:__

This stuff can be used with/for

- Enhancing sauces
- On cheese instead of marmalade or jam, very nice with blue cheese or so my mom tells me (I hate that stuff)
- In salad dressings
- Complement to cheese cakes
- Complement to steak
- Use for sweetness in a casserole

Hope you will enjoy it
