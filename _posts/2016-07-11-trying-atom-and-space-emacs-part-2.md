title: Trying Atom and Spacmacs part 2
categories: programming editor
---
I have now used Atom and Spacemacs for a bit over 2 weeks and I have a few things to say, both negative 
and positive things. 

# Spacemacs

I will start with Spacemacs, because it is the editor I have the least comments for, but also the one 
which have proven the biggest challenges. As stated in the first post Spacemacs is an editor build on top 
of Emacs, with packets already available in MELPA. Therefore this editor is immediately familiar to me and 
easy to use in some ways, but there are also things annoy the hell out of me. 

Firstly, I have setup Spacemacs to use the standard shortcuts for Quit, Save, Open, Cut, Copy and Past. This 
was a bliss at first, but then I realised something which annoys the spirit out of my body and that is Open. 
In standard Emacs `C-x f` "open" the find file menu, but with the setup of Mac which uses `CMD +o` opens the
open dialog which in itself is fine IF NOT, it also opens a second instance of Spacemacs which is not what I 
am expecting when I try to open a document in an editor based on Emacs. 

Secondly `SPC`, in Spacemacs `SPC` is the main key like `CTRL` is in Emacs, however I do not know if it is me
whom is a moron or if both my Linux and OS X Spacemacs installation is broke, but I can get `SPC` to do exactly 
nothing, resulting in the problem that I fall back on Emacs key bindings which I was trying to avoid. Why this
is the case I have not yet figure, I have talked to friends whom have used Spacemacs for a longer time than I. 
They are unable to find the problem with my installations and therefore it is a problem. 

Now enough negative about Spacemacs. The positive thing with Spacemacs is that it is easier to maintain settings 
and organiser once settings. I particular like the way layers works, which I might will be writing a blog post about
later. 

But due to the fact that I constantly fall back to Emacs key bindings, I do not think I can give a proper review of 
Spacemacs yet. 

# Atom
As I wrote in the last blog post I have used Atom at work and it is a bliss. It is easy to setup and find plug ins 
for this editor. The key bindings are simple and I rarely use the mouse, only if I need to find a file in a sub folder 
which I am not completely sure what name is. Or I switch to a BASH Terminal and uses `LS` command. I really have no 
complaints about Atom so far. I had one small problem and that was getting Spelling to work in the editor, but after 
a packet update of _spell-check_ that was fixed. 

# So far
So far I am tilting towards either returning to Emacs or switching to Atom, but until I have fixed the problems with 
Spacemacs and given it a proper try, I will not put it in the graveyard because I really like the UI and the way layers 
are used for managing settings.
