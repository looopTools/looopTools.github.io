I have on social network and meme sites read about the wish to create a Atheist state / country. People have had some good and bad discussions on why it is a good or a bad idea. But I would like to give my opinion on this subject as an agnostic atheist my self.

But before I start to give my opinion on this, I would like to explain what an agnostic atheist is. So you will under stand my perspective better.

An agnostic is a person whom says _you have not prove either that a god does not exist nor that a god does not exist. So until Î see definitive proof for either case, I believe that a almighty god does not exist._ An agnostic atheist is a subgroup of agnostics, and are those who predominately does not believe in a god, yet they still have doubts. Though I would like to note that most atheist I know see me as pure atheist, and see all agnostic atheist as atheists. However I do not my self.

Anyways back on topic. So what is the basis of this "analysis", what is this based upon? Well I am basing this on my experience with the danish educational systems and politics in general. But also what I have heard about governments around the world and the influence religion have on a given government. So without further introduction, let us get started.

## Why is a Atheist state a good idea?
During my first 10 years in the danish school system, I did not focus on the influence religion had on the government, but rather the influence it had on the education and lectures it self. Now Denmark is a country with Christianity as the main religion, so when I attend the 0th to second grade, I was taught a subject called Christianity, which basically was preaching during the young educational years. After second grade I was taught about different religions but mainly ancient religions such as Greek, Norse and Celtic, but not "modern" religions such as Islam. By such we were not informed about the "alternatives" to Christianity and was semi told that Christianity was/is the only option.

In my opinion this indoctrination performed in the early years of a child's education, is dangerous, as it closes and clouds both the judgment at mind of young children. For instance during my education I have heard this during my first Science class _But god create earth..._ and then the science teacher had to "cruch" the young girls perspective on planet earth. It actually mad it hard for her to understand Science and in particular how it was not a God how did so she did not fall of the planet.

So in education it is important to introduce an atheistic based point of view. With this I do not mean to remove religion from the curriculum, but rather move the religious subject to the later grades and reform it so it is not taught as truth, but as philosophy and not just concentrate on a single religion, but on as many as possible and explain the difference, but also the similarities so that an understanding of all can be achived.

So in the sense of early education, students should not be subject to relegious influenced in the beging of their education. In this sense a state or rather a school system which is based on atheisme, where proff is required before stating something as a fact. Off course it is important also to ensure that an atheist school system does not make an enemy of religion, rather explain what it is and why it can be beautiful.

During the the early start of this millennial and even up till 2012 (even now) there where a lot of focus on LGBT rights, not just in Denmark but the entire world. However in Denmark the discussion was not if gay couple should be allowed to register as partners nor get married by a mayor. But if they should be allowed to be married in a Church. The discussion went on until 2015 where the law was past in Parliament and will soon be instated. HOWEVER!!!! Though I am 100% for freedom of religion and sexuality. I am against enforced laws on a any group if it is against a given believe. By such argument it is wrong to enforce gay marriage on the Christian Church, as homosexuality is against the christian believe. A division between Church and state, it would be harder to impose such laws on the Church and the Church will have a harder time influencing the State.

I would like to emphasis that I am not again gay marriage, I am against imposing laws on a religion unless the law is put in place to defend humans or animals against the religion.

An example on where I find it is fine for the state to put out laws against certain practices of religion, for instance Halāl butchering of animals. As it has been proven to harm the animal butchered through this method. So to protect a creature against religion these kinds of laws is fine, but that is just my opinion. It is not because I am against neither Judaism nor Islam, but against the inhuman practices which Halāl is.

So in my opinion an Atheist based state would be a good idea, if it is done properly. Such that it is not impossible to live by a religion, but protect the people in a reasonable way.
