So as you might have noticed, the blog is in scrambles. There are a couple of reasons
for this which I will cover in this blog post. I will also cover why I have not be blogging,
but also what topic I will blog about in the near future and also a bit about what is going on in my life.

So let us get started

# Scrambles and why

If you have followed this blog for a while you will noticed, that I have changed back to a more standard
Jekyll theme (if you know Jekyll). This change was committed and worked as it should. However, I wrongly
executed a commit all script in the blog root and by such a lot of draft post was published which I was
working on. Therefore the blog is currently in scrambles, and it will take me a bit of time to edit and
sort out the problems.

# Why I have not been blogging and what to come

When I started at my Masters degree back in September, at lot of things change. Firstly the project group
which I have been a part of for the past two and half years, split into atoms and I had to find a new group.
Luckily I found that during the summer break, but it still have taken some adjustments and by such I have
spend a lot of time on that.

Secondly, due to a (sorry Professor) hopeless course and style of lecturing, I have had to study an entire
course based only on literature, instead of lectures and literature. Which is a completely new concept to
me and it has consumed a lot of time.

Finally, due to different aspirations I have had during the summer break and start of the semester. I have
been completed stressed out, all at my own account and fault. However, it have had me lash out at friends
and comrades, resulting in me having to patch up a lot of things.

Those three factors have done such that I have been completely drained of energy and times. Hopefully I will
become better at controlling myself and spend time on project I 100 percent care for and find less stressful.

# What is going on with my life

I am still attending Aalborg University, just as a master student instead of a bachelor. I have also both
chosen a topic and found a project for my 9th semester project and master thesis. Which I will begin in about
a year. However, at the moment I am not at liberty to name the subject of either project nor thesis. I will state
that it is about performance benchmarking and parallel programming. I have also found a supervisor to each
project, again not at liberty to say who (yet). I will though state that the both will be done in collaboration
with a company (guess which) and I might need a co-supervisor from another department at the university.

# Topics to come

Here I will write a few topics I am going to write blog post about in the coming months

- Going Markdown
- Functional programming, why its a curse and a blessing
- Emacs, a welcome home
- Archetypes - A "class" of characters in my books universe
- The war and the fall that followed - Prelude to my book (a very shorted version of the back storry)
- Why I continue with Mac
- Goodbye Manjaro, hello again Fedora
- MacBrew - A new open source project
- irisPause - The saga continues
- More book stuff

Best Regards,
