__Will add references later I have them__

So over the last 5 - 10 years many people have become more focused on
privacy when communicating, not just with colleagues, customers, and
employers, but also for private communications. The reason for this is
that we now know that Google, Facebook, and other companies _"peek"_
in our correspondence with others, to identify relevant, for them,
information. It is known that Facebook use the information to tailor
commercials more aggressively towards you and its know that companies,
not just Facebook, sell the information to other companies and we
simply do not know what they do with the information. So how can we as
users of this service combat this and can we actually defend combating
these procedures?

I will start by answering the later. Well the answer is complex, if
one can remember as far back as the mid nineties one would remember
that we paid to use certain services such as mail services and search
engines, even web browsers if you can believe it. However, this
changed with the introduction of products such as Internet Explorer,
Altavista, Yahoo, MSN, Hotmail, Google Search, and more, with these
products the _"free"_ internet was born. The problem was/is that the
companies which provide these products still need to make money, and
how can they do that? Well, advertisement, remember a time before
NoScript and uBlock when the internet was covered in adds? That was a
solution, however, how did companies prove that an add campaign was
effective? Well you could correlate increase in revenue with the
period of the add, or you could do something much simpler, track how
many clicks the add. Sounds familiar? No? Well this is one of the ways
tracking started, there are multiple others, and after some time some
people thought; _Well, what if we can create a profile of the person to target adds more specifically to that user?_, 
letting to user profiling. So tracking rose from a need to earn money 
and by avoiding tracking we reduce a company's money flow. So, 
because we did not want to pay for internet services we are at directly 
at fault for tracking. However, companies are super invasive and does 
not necessarily require you to use their system to track you, an 
example is Facebook, they track who ever visits a website that has
a Facebook like button. So if I do not use Facebook why should I 
allow Facebook to track me? Well I should not. Additionally it 
is know that Google scan our gMail content to, amongst other things, 
build a profile of you. Well it is fair because gMail is free, but 
why then not offer a paid version where you can avoid that? Why 
can we not opt out of tracking? Simple to much money is to be made
and tracking is now a core part of a lot of systems. So to summarise, 
if you use a services for free it is fair that you get track, it is
your own fault, but if you do not use a company's service they have 
no right to track you. 

But I do not like tracking either way so how do I avoid it? Well it is
close to impossible to 100% avoid tracking and I cannot.  I use
NoScript to block Google Analytics and other fancy stuff, I use uBlock
to say f... you to adds. That is all good and well, but how do I avoid
Google, Facebook, or who ever, the NSA for instance reading my emails
and messages? Well I use products that provides privacy. For email
there is multiple options, ProtonMail is a good example, and of those
options I went with Tutanota which is located in Germany. Tutanota
encrypts your mail on their server and allows you to send encrypted
emails, even to people without Tutanota accounts, whilst avoid the
need to exchange PGP-keys. It is super easy to use, only problem for
me is that there is not a desktop application. But the web client is
pretty good. Instant messaging on the other hand... that is a tough
one, the reason for that is that in Denmark most do not use SMS
anymore but use Facebook Messenger or SnapChat, exactly what I am
trying to avoid. However, due to the resent public focus on privacy
more and more are switching back to SMS or other services, for
instance WhatsApp. But again a problem, a Cell Service Provide can
read your SMS'es and WhatsApp is owned by Facebook. So what do we do
well we can look at service such as Telegram, which I also use, but
the problem is that companies such as Telegram do not explain how they
make money or what legal restrictions they are under. So the main
option for me is Signal from Open Whisper Systems. They explain how
they make money, what legal restrictions they are under AND more
importantly to me, almost everything they make is open source, so we
can evaluated what is actually happening. Signal provides end-to-end
encrypted messaging so they cannot analyse your data and neither can
others. So that is why I use Tutanota and Signal.
