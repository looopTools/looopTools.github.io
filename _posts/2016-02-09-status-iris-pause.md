This is just a very small status update about irisPause.

First I am pleased to say irisPause is working almost as expected, I am still tinkering with some UI component problems. But these problems should be fixed at the latest in the end of February.

Good news in the terms of resource usage, I have had the current version of the application running for a couple of hours and I have never seen more that 4KB of memory usage, which I am very pleased with.

I will again call for alpha and beta testers to make certain that the application works properly before releasing the first stable version.
