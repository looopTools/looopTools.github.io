This post is kind of philosophical, so sorry in advance, if I offend anyone.

I spend some time on 9GAG discussing why _"We all gonna die"_ is not a sad story and essential why it is not a sad thing to die. I know 9GAG is not a very good place to have constructive discussions, however I think this was one and I will like to write a bit about it here.

First of I am looking predominately from the person whom dies point of view, in my own opinion. But I will also take in to account the relatives.

## Why do we see it as sad to die?

Well that depends on a lot of things; Is the person young? Is the person old? Is the person someone you love? Do you leave anyone behind? Was the person sick? All of these factors are relevant when I explain why it is not sad when some dies.

### Is the person young?

What people do not or rather will not realise is that in the past century alone, humans have expanded the average life span of our species with over 20 years (in the west), and it was not uncommon that people under 50 died due to the stress their workload put upon them or work accidents.

Today we see it as abnormal if a human under 50 die unless it is an accident, violence or due to a period of severe illness, and really, really sad. But why? Even though a life is cut short, why is sad? Is it because a person had so much to life for, so many goals they or you wanted them to achieve?

Because that is not a sad thing and the reason it is a sad thing, is due to the following: Look at it pragmatically a life was not cut short, it was simply not longer. Yes they had goals and you had goals for them, BUT! These goals can simply not be fulfilled nor are they destroyed, they simply ceases to exists, that is not a sad thing, it is a logical thing to do and it will ease your own grief.

### Is the person old?

Then it cannot come as a surprise, the only reason you will be sad is for yourself. It is because you either love the person or have not complete something you want to do with or for the person.

Be rational and logical, then you will understand that it was not your fault they died. Learn from the experience, learn to not put things off, unless you have to. That is harsh way to learn it, but a good way. Change you sadness it joy that the person is at peace and use your energy to help others get over their sorrow.

### Is the person someone you loved?

Often when you fell sadness over someones death, it is due to the fact that you love them and that you know you are going to miss the and you wish you could have done more to keep them alive. However why not see it as a good thing? Why not see it as they finally got peace? That you are sad about losing some you lost, does not make death a sad thing, it means that you had someone you cherished in your life. That is an amazing gift and not something you should take likely, see that see the amazing gift.

### Do you leave anyone behind

Well it might hurt those whom you do leave behind, but it will heal over time and the lose will either make them stronger or make them realise how much they actually loves you. That is a gift for them not something sad, they will realise what they had and what they could/should be for their relatives.

### Was the person sick?

Well then they got the peace they deserved

## Basically what I say is...
Basically what I say is: Death is only sad in the eyes of the survivor, and in my opinion that is only due to the fact that people only look on the sad part of death, not the relive of death and the peace it brings to the person whom have died.
