__This post will be update on the go due to exam period __
[linux.com](http://www.linux.com), a news side about linux and open source brought to us by linuxfoundation, has released its list for _The Best Linux Distros for 2017_[[1]](https://www.linux.com/news/learn/sysadmin/best-linux-distributions-2017). Which places Elementary OS[[2]](https://elementary.io/) as the best linux desktop distribution.

However, surprisingly I disagree. The reason I disagree, is not that I am against Ubuntu[3](https://www.ubuntu.com/), which I do not like. The reason is that I think _linux.com_ actually overlook a lot of distributions out there which are better suited for desktops. I will here present the three distributions which I see as the best desktop distributions and why, also I will argue why I see Fedora as overlooked.

__OpenSUSE__[[4]](https://www.opensuse.org/): This is a distribution which have had a lot of ups and downs, and I must I abandoned it, in its darkest days. But in the last couple of years, it has been given an infusion of new blood, which strive to make it a really, really good and have update the system and made it more stable, faster than I have ever seen before in a linux distribution. The system is extremely versatile and can be used for both enterprise and private usage, and for prior windows uses does the standard version come with KDE, so it is a very familiar experience. Which is actually the reason why I see it as overlooked, its turn around and familiarity.

__Sabayon__[[5]](https://www.sabayon.org/): This is a gentoo[[6]](https://www.gentoo.org/) based distribution, which makes Gentoo approachable and it is extremely efficient, easy to use, and very resource light. Meaning that you as a user do not have to spend a lot of money on hardware. An advantage Sabayon has is that it provides almost all good desktop, Desktop Environment and Windows Managers. Additionally everything which working on Gentoo works on Sabayon ensuring continuous development.

__Fedora__[[7]](https://fedoraproject.org/): Fedora is a distribution which is heavily supported by Redhat and by such there is already offered a enterprise version of this distribution. But Fedora is close to bleeding edge and is update every 6 months, providing a stable and really awesome distribution.
