title:  "Trying Atom and Spacemacs"
categories: programming, editor

For years I have used Emacs and have been a happy "customer". But I have a
problem. The problem is my wrist, they hurt and they hurt a lot from time to
time. One of my colleagues have similar problems though worse than mine and he
is also a long time Emacs user. Due to his problems he have research different
editors and made comparisons and have selected to try out [Atom](https://atom.io),
which is an editor provide by Github. Besides my colleagues decision to tryout
Atom, I have heard quite a lot about a "new" editor called [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org).
Which amongst other things focuses on ergonomics and try to lessen the chance
of RSI problems. But it is basically a module for Emacs and is using a ton of
plugins already available through [MELPA](https://melpa.org)

Due to my own problems with my wrists I have selected to also tryout a new
editor. But I really like the power of Emacs and the fact that I do not need a
mouse to use it. So instead of trying out one editor I will be trying out two
over the summer. I will be using Atom at work and Spacemacs at home. You may not
see this as a fair division but the fact is that I code and write text at home
a lot. So I see it as a fair division.

My goal is to find a editor which like Emacs does not get in my way and are
vastly extendable and I will enjoy to use, just as much as I enjoy using Emacs.
So far I have been using Atom for a two days and Spacemacs for three days. Both
editors have some purges which vanilla Emacs does not and both are very modular.
For programming at work I can say that I have been satisfied with Atom so far
and for editing LaTeX and writing chapters for my book I have been satisfied
with Spacemacs.

I will be reporting in once every other week, giving my opinions on which
editor is the best, what problems I have had, my success stories and what editor
I prefer at the given time. This experiment should hopefully end out, with me
either having a new editor or realizing nothing beats Emacs.

Some may wonder why is he not trying out SublimeText, TextMate or Vi(m)? There
is a very simple reason for that. Over the years I have tried all three and I
actually use Vi and Vim on servers where Emacs is not installed and I have no
problem using it. But with SublimeText and TextMate I have always ended up with
a problem where I was unable to find a solution (not saying that it does not
    exists) and have therefore returned to Emacs. So why not Vi(m)? Well ehhhhh
very good question, it is not a question of ideology like EMACS IS THE ONLY
FUCKING THING, because Vi(m) is awesome and is right up there with Emacs in my
opinion. There is simply something with the workflow of Vi(m) and the different
modes (insert, edit, etc.) I do not like and each time I have tried Vi(m) as my
main editor I have always returned to Emacs. So therefore I will not be trying
these editors.

Some may also wonder why I do not use an Integrate Development Environment (IDE).
Well I have some favorite IDE's IntelliJ IDEA and Microsoft Visual Studio. But I
have a couple of problems with IDE's, most are:

- Resource heavy
- Single purpose
- Point and click

In the terms of resource heavy, most IDE's are very RAM consuming without a good
reason in my opinion and are therefore very badly designed. Single purpose
Microsoft Visual Studio does C#, C and C++ very well but sucks at other language
and IntelliJ idea have a similar problem just with a different set of programming
languages. I want a system which I can use for all and do all well, which I think
Emacs actually do very well, even with proprietary languages such as C# and F#.
Point and click I hate having to use the mouse and a lot of IDE's cannot fully
be used without the mouse and therefore it is a giant problem for me. My RSI
problems really comes into them self, when I use the mouse and that is why I
prefer not having to use it.

So now the stage is set and I will be using these editors during the rest of
June, July and August and make a decision in the end of August. I hope this
might help you make a decision when you will have to choose your editor.
