So I will start at university again next week and by such my
summer is over and so it is time for me to decide between
Emacs and Atom.

First I would like to remind you why I decided to try out other
editors. I started trying others editors due to RSI problems
and I suspect one of the reasons for my RSI issues was Emacs
and it strange key bindings. This let to that I wanted to try
out other editors.

I started out with trying out both Spacemacs and Atom. Where I
found Spacemacs impossible to setup at least for me and therefore
I ended to only focused on Atom. Which I have already written
a blog post about this topic, so see that please.

So what is the result and why is the result as is? Well I have
actually decided on something I usually do not do. I have decided
to continue to use both Atom and Emacs.

I normally never use two tools for the same thing, but I simply do
not think I have spend enough time with Atom yet to dismiss, but
I still prefer Emacs (surprise). But do really like Atom, and would
like to get to know it even more. Because I think with a couple of
months additional usage of Atom, it might actually become my preferred
editor (if I can get the damn British dictionary to work).

That is actually basically that. The only difference I will be
using Atom only at work and for my study development work. While I
will continue using Emacs for writing my documents and books.
