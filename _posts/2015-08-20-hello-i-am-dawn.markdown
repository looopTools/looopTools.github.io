This is the first post about characters from my book project, Three sisters, three faiths. This series of posts, will contain a small introduction of the character, by the character self.
_- Lars Nielsen_

Hello I am Dawn. I am the youngest of a set of triples and the cutest or so I think at least. I am always up early in the morning, unlike my other sisters and this is due to the fact, that I love the colours of the sky in the morning. As you will read the stories of my sisters and I, you will realise that I have no clue at all, that I was descended of Angels and I do not see it as something special. I really hope you will come to like me best, because I love new friends.

I will write a bit more about my self later. Hope you will have wonderful day until the next time we communicate through writing.

_- Dawn Nerana_
