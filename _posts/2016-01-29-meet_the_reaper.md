It was a foggy day in the forest and Kraven was nervous, something which was rare for him.
But today it felt like he was being watched and as he could not see very far, it made him nervous.
Though nervous he kept working, the project was important, the border was important and
not even nervousness would keep him from his task, not even if he meet death himself, would Kraven
stop working on his project. For to long had the Kiljaren, threatened his peoples borders, for to long
had his people, his friends, his family lived in fear of the dark Kiljarens.

The war was tiresome and though a treaty was on the horizon, Kraven believed it to be a long way a way. Because of this
and while the rest of his people was resting and enjoying a bit of peace, Kraven was in the forest
on the furthers border away from Emberas, on the very edge of Imalaria, to lay traps, build fortifications
and make certain no spies, warriors or other unwanted beings crossed the border. He worked tirelessly
and was focused on his task, any who saw him working would think he was focusing on nothing else.
But Kraven was an Akiran, the Kiljaren called him *the shadow of death*, they said death rested in his
eyes. He could focus on many things, and yet focus on one thing and even though it was very foggy, he could
sense something was out of place, slowly he laid down the tools in his hands and went for the dagger in
his sleeve. However before he reached the dagger, a woman's voice sound from behind. "Are you going to kill me?
that would be strange you give me so much work", Kraven drew the dagger and turned.

There stood a women or what Kraven assumed was a women, she wore a pure white cloak with the hood drawn up, so it was impossible to see her face.
Though her face was covered, Kraven felt like the women was surveying him, not like a hunter or an attacker would,
but rather like someone whom had found an interesting tool and was analysing how to best utilise this
new found tool. "Who are you" asked Kraven with out lowering his dagger, the women answered "I am Tiaran" she
answered and spoke on "Yet you are asking the wrong question, you should not be asking who I am,
but what I am and why I have come". She paused for a bit, and to Kraven it seemed like she tilted her head a bit to the right,
then continued "Will you not lower your dagger, though it gives me work, it cannot harm me". Kraven took a step back
and asked "What are you if this blade cannot harm you" his voice made it clear that he was shaken, not many knew what the blade
was made of and yet he felt this creature knew and was not afraid. Kraven had only ever known of one race which did not fear
the silver off heaven and that was the sons and daughters of Heaven itself.

"You start to ask the correct question, yet do not fear, for
I am not here to hurt you" she said in a very kind almost musical voice, yet Kraven did not feel calm. Kraven sensed
that this creature could sense his unease, yet she continued speaking "I am Tiaran, daughter of Razaphel, whom I believe you already
know" the last part sounding like an already answered question, something clicked for Kraven, he knew what this creature was
and it did not make him any calmer, these creatures only showed them self, if one where close to death. Tiaran laughed and
said "oh you are far from close to death, I am not here as a warning of death nor am I here to take your home", she spoke now
in a light almost smiling voice. "But y.. yo.. you are a reaper are you not, a daughter of death, a herald of your father, a daughter
if Nyxiel her self mother of Night", Kraven said chocked, yet not afraid. "I am and must I say for a being so close to human
as your kind are, you impress me" she said sounding impressed and continued "Not many knowing what I am, can lay their eyes upon me
and not quiver in fear, I see why you are known as *the fearless one* even amongst children of both heaven and hell",
it sound almost like Tiaran was both concerned and impressed. Kraven spoke again this time more calm and more controlled "If you my lady
are not here to take me home, then why are you here", even though Tiaran's hood was drawn, Kraven could feel her focusing, preparing to
do what ever she was there to do. "I am Tiaran daughter of death and night, one of the oldest reapers, but I am also the messenger of death,
and I bring a warning from death himself, will you hear the warning and if so I shall warn you my self".

Kraven looked upon her it had been a long time, since a being of heaven had a warning for him, and now he realised why he was nervous, it was the
dark parts of himself, they reacted with the light of heaven, as he thought this Tiara nodded and said "You are right Kraven, you have much of
hell in you, but I also still sense a lot of heaven, will you hear the warning". Kraven answered "I will hear the warning, but if I will take it
to heart I cannot say yet", though he could not see Tiran's face, he could feel her smile. Then she spoke "In three days time Kiljaren
and 10 of his people shall come through here wearing white, you must not attack, you must not reveal yourself, for they bring peace, the treaty they will offer
shall bring peace, stability and blossom to your people, but it will bring you suffering you have never felt, yet I Razaphel angel of death say,
take the peace, accept the treaty or you shall suffer even more", her voice was kind, but serious and she glowed with a warmth which reminded
Kraven of the hearth of heaven, after a very small pause Tiaran spoke again "Now for my warning, when the treaty is signed Kraven, do not linger
it will increase your pain, instead travel to my mother and she shall help you, travel the world of men and they shall teach you, walk the path
of the seeker, walk the path of the scholar and your pain shall be lessened" Tiaran sound sad and spoke again "I know you have suffered, I know you have lost,
I know you have saved many lives, but I hope you will follow both our advises and hear the warnings, but decide not now, for you will not understand, until
you hear the terms of the treaty". Kraven looked at her and said "I have yet to receive a good word from heaven, I wonder if it ever will come,
but I respect and trust your fathers wisdom", Tiaran tilted her head backup right, and said "Never have I laid my eyes up on a creature like you,
no fear of death or pain, but a fear of peace, that is rare and dangerous, I shall leave you now, may your choices favour all well", Tiaran bowed and in a
burst of white flames she disappeared. Kraven looked around for a very short bit, then he sheaved his dagger and went back to his project.

[END]

This is the first story in a series of smaller stories, which all has the objective of filling holes in the time line of the book series I am working on.
They will only be published here on the site (at least that is the plan for now). But I also see this as a possibility for for you as a reader to get to know some of
the characters better and give me feedback if you like. I will like to point out that no one will proofread these short stories, nor will I get a second opinion, before they are posted.
I will however like your opinion, so send me an e-mail or a tweet.
