    Now let us get personal. First of all if you got this far, thank you for your interest and welcome
    to my little corner of the wast massive network we call the internet. As stated above I am freaking
    nerd, I love software development and learning new programming languages, playing board games and
    writing. I am also the author of a couple of open source applications and software libraries my self
    and have contributed to open source throughout my active software development years. I hope you enjoy
    my web page and the content.
    </p>

    A bit arrogant, so sorry in advance, a couple of persons have contact me about why I do not have a patron
    page, have created a kick starer for my book, or ask for donations on my open source projects github pages.
    Well I am of the opinion that as long, as I can pay for my food and my apartment I see no reason to ask for
    additional money. However I am still a student, so I do not live a life of luxury. But if you want to change
    that a bit, you can buy me something from my Amazon wish list: <a class="fa fa-amazon" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/3FZQ1T6OPVM1D"></a>
