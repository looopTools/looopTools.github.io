Hello and welcome to my website, blog and online portfolio. <br />
I am danish student and software developer, located in Aalborg. Where I study software engineering and work as a student developer at Steinwurf.

I like to think a lot about subjects which can be improved with software and how to improve or solve a given problem, using software.

In my current position as student software developer, my main focus is to devlop, improve and extend software bindings and libraries.

Besides my study I am *NIX enthusiast and love to use different flavours of Linux, BSD, OS X and so on.
