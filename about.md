__Name:__ Lars Nielsen <br />
<hr />
I am man from Denmark, currently located in Aalborg, where I study Software Engineering at Aalborg University and work as a student software developer at Steinwurf.

In spend my leisure time on writing short stories, working on a novel, small software projects and of course since I am danish drinking with friends.

In my work and in my studies, I like to focus on semi low level development and programming languages bindings for software libraries.
