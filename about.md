Hello, I am Lars, student, software developer, (hopefully) author, open source evangelist and nerd.

Hello and welcome to my little corner of the wast and weird internet. <br />
As stated my names is Lars, and I am student and Software Developer from Denmark, currently located in Aalborg. I am a student at Aalborg University
and is currently on the final semester of my B.Sc EE in Software. Besides my study I am also a student Software Developer at Steinwurf.

## A bit more personal
I am from 1989 and I have always lived in Denmark, with a couple of very very tiny stays (months) in Spain and the United Kingdom. I am often described
as a first class nerd (which is not incorrect), as I enjoy logic, reasoning, math, programming, Pen and Paper RPG, board games, books and more. I am currently
living alone in a small aparment.

My lives dream is to become a published author of a fantasy series and to become a *NIX kernel developer. Though the later is starting to switch over to a more
Network Coding based senario.

I am an open source evangelist, though I use OS X, and have over the years contributed to different open source projects, though normally in very small batches
at a time, exmaple projects could be Mozilla Core and Addon-SDK (also Mozilla project). I love the open source community and the possibility of giving back to
the community.
